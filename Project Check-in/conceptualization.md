# Proposal: 

## Project title -
> Bowed String Modeling Synthesizer (probably want a cooler name)
>> This will be a synthesizer which creates a bowed string sound with more convinving articulations. The synthesizer should have precise control over the envelope of the sound, selecting between articulation types which are accurate to the way a human string player would begin and end a note with the bow. 

## Objectives and scope -
> The synth should be able to handle multiple types of articulations (staccato, legato, sforzando, detache). Within the program there should also be some control over how the instrument will transition between notes, whether fully connected and slurred or very short like a bow coming off the string. Some tone control would be a nice addition, although the tone doesn't need to be 100% realistic (artificial sounding strings are okay as long as the start / stop of the note is convincing)

## Anticipated resources -
> I will need to research various methods for string synthesis (FM, KarplusStrong, etc). Additionally I'll search for data on bowed string sounds and how the sound evolves over the length of one note. What overtones are more present during the transient? Which overtones fall off first as the note sustains? As the bow comes off the string? (I could maybe conduct some research myself...)

## Timeline with milestones -
> week 1:
>> Researching different string modeling algorithms
>> Look for documentation on physical bowed strings (for shaping / filtering the string sound as it evolves)

> week 2:
>> Build a simple program which makes sound (for experimenting with and comparing different synthesis tecnniques)
>> Decide which techniques will be used for the final synth
>> Decide how many articulation and release types will be used

> week 3 (prototyping):
>> Design ideas for the user interface (how will user select between articulations and release types? will it use a sequencer or a MIDI input? what sort of tone control?)
>> 
>>

> week 4:
>> Final testing and tweaking
>> Preparing for presentation.
