> My other idea involves synthesizing some decent string sounds with more convincing articulations. I'm always disappointed by VST strings in the way the instruments attack a note and how they handle transitions between notes. Ideally I would program multiple different articulations that would be used by a human string player or string quartet (staccato, legato, sforzando, detache). Within the program there should also be some control over how the instrument will transition between notes, whether fully connected and slurred or very short like a bow coming off the string.

# Proposal: 

## Project title -
> Bowed String Modeling Synthesizer
>> This will be a synthesizer which creates a bowed string sound. Most importantly the synthesizer will have some precise control over the articulation and envelope of the sound. The synthesizer should produce convincing articulations, accurate to the way a human string player would begin a note with the bow. 

## Objectives and scope -
> The synth should be able to handle multiple types of articulations (staccato, legato, sforzando, detache). Within the program there should also be some control over how the instrument will transition between notes, whether fully connected and slurred or very short like a bow coming off the string. 

## Anticipated resources -
> I will need to research various methods for string synthesis. Additionally I'll search for data on bowed string instruments and the way the sound evolves across one note. What overtones are more present during the transient and which fall off the first as the note sustains. I could even conduct some research myself. Measuring
