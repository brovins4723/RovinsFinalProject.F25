For this final project I have two ideas that I'm throwing around. Both come from a need to synthesize sounds for my own music :

- #1
    I'm always interested in micro drum sound and building grooves / drumkits with very short percussive electronic sounds (plucks, bursts of noise, thumps, etc.) I love music that uses these very inhuman sounding instruments, sounding very close to the source, but somehow played / programmed with a very human feel. One idea would be to create a sequencer with some simple envelope or transient control as well as a very detailed velocity control
