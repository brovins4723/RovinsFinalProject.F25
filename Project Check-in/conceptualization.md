For this final project I have two ideas that I'm throwing around. Both come from a need to synthesize sounds for my own music :

## #1
> I've always been interested in micro sort of drum sounds, and building grooves / drumkits with very short percussive electronic sounds (plucks, bursts of noise, thumps, etc.) I love music that uses these very non-human sounding instruments which sound very close in the mix, but somehow played / programmed with a very human feel. One idea would be to create a sequencer with some simple envelope or transient control as well as a very detailed velocity control. For the envelope editor I'm imagining something like a function breakpoint object from MaxMSP. The sequencer however should be very flexible, allowing for programming of odd meters and assymetrical beats.
## #2
> My other idea involves synthesizing some decent string sounds with more convincing articulations. I'm always disappointed by VST strings in the way the instruments attack a note and how they handle transitions between notes. Ideally I would program multiple different articulations that would be used by a human string player or string quartet (staccato, legato, sforzando, detache). Within the program there should also be some control over how the instrument will transition between notes, whether fully connected and slurred or very short like a bow coming off the string.

Proposal: 

Project title -
> Bowed String Modeling Synthesizer
>> This will be a synthesizer which creates a bowed string sound. Most importantly the synthesizer will have some in-depth control over the articulation and envelope of the sound. The synthesizer should produce convincing articulations, accurate to the way a human string player would begin a note with the bow. 

Objectives and scope -

Anticipated resources -
> I will need to research various methods for string synthesis. Additionally I will need to find data on the transients of various articulation types on string instruments.
